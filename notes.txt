-works using python 2.7.9, dont know if you need it installed to run the app

-you'll need to edit the serial settings and recompile to get it working with the lights

-played around with some of the beat detect stuff for variace reasons and its not working as well at the moment. if it stops detecting the kicks, adjust the volume

-have instructions for writing the scripts in "./bin/data/templateScenes.py"
